# Mayhemfile: configuration file for testing your target with Mayhem
# Format: YAML 1.1

# Mayhemfile version specifier
version: '1.16'

# project: The organization and project name to run under Mayhem
#
# $ORGANIZATION/$PROJECT
#
project: mayhem/netflix

# target: The target name. This will be replaced at build time to
#         reflect the branch under analysis.
#
# $HARNESS-NAME-$BRANCH
#
target: dial-reference

#  baseimage: The tag of the Docker Image uploaded to Mayhem for analysis.
#             This will be replaced at build time because the tag will
#             include the name of the branch under analysis.
#
#             This image must exist in a publicly accessible registry, such
#             as Dockerhub; or uploaded into the registry included in the
#             Mayhem deployment (what is done in this demonstration).
#
baseimage: $MAYHEM_DOCKER_REGISTRY/mayhem-netflix-dial-reference:latest

# duration: Time that analysis will run for in seconds - if absent, run forever
#           Because the primary branch is continuously fuzzed, this can be set to
#           blank (for infinite). Other branches only run regression tests which
#           do not consider the duration property.
#
duration: 86400

# advanced_triage:  Turns on extra test case processing (completing a run will
#                   take longer)
#
advanced_triage: false
